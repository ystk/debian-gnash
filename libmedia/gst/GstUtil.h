 /**
 * \brief Returns a pointer to GstElement representing a user-configurable
 * audio sink, or NULL if such a sink could not be created.
 * 
 * get_audiosink_element() tries the following strategies to get an audiosink:
 * 1. Looks into ~/.gnashrc for a pipeline description given by the property
 *    GSTAudioSink
 * 2. If none (or invalid) is found, tries "autoaudiosink"
 * 3. If autoaudiosink comes up blank, tries "gconfaudiosink"
 * 4. If gconfaudiosink can't produce a non-NULL element, the method returns
 *    NULL.
 *
 * A pipeline description is specified in one of two ways in ~/.gnashrc:
 * 1. A "trivial" pipeline is simply the name of an element, like "fakesink"
 * 2. A "non-trivial" pipeline is a full sub-pipeline specification, given
 *    in a way that complies with the gst-launch manual page. The audiosink's
 *    sub-pipeline must accept x/raw-{int,float} data and feed it into a sink.
 *    The entire audiosink will be placed in a GstBin named "gnashrcsink" with
 *    a number based on the number of gnashrcsinks that have been allocated so
 *    far.
