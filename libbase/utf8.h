/// Utilities to convert between std::string and std::wstring.
//
/// Strings in Gnash are generally stored as std::strings.
/// We have to deal, however, with characters larger than standard
/// ASCII (128), which can be encoded in two different ways.
///
/// SWF6 and later use UTF-8, encoded as multibyte characters and
/// allowing many thousands of unique codes. Multibyte characters are 
/// difficult to handle, as their length - used for many string
/// operations - is not certain without parsing the string.
/// Converting the string to a wstring (generally a uint32_t - the 
/// pp seems only to handle characters up to 65535 - two bytes is
/// the minimum size of a wchar) facilitates string operations, as
/// the length of the string is equal to the number of valid characters. 
/// 
/// SWF5 and earlier, however, used the ISO-8859 specification,
/// allowing the standard 128 ASCII characters plus 128 extra
/// characters that depend on the particular subset of ISO-8859.
/// Characters are 8 bits, not the ASCII standard 7. SWF5 cannot
/// handle multi-byte characters without special functions.
///
/// It is important that SWF5 can distinguish between the two encodings,
/// so we cannot convert all strings to UTF-8.
///
/// Presently, this code is used for the AS String object,
/// gnash::edit_text_character, ord() and chr().
