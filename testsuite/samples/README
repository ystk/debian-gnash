== Origin == 

Produced by dongdong <dedodong@163.com> (a friend of Zou Lunkai).
Zou asked his permission to included the movie into Gnash testsuite.
Dongdong reported bug #18916, now closed.

== Description ==

Executes gotoFrame actions in response to key events.
Expected behaviour is described by textfields, so should be intuitive.

= [sound1.swf] =

== Origin == 

== Description ==

Plays two small sounds played in sequence.
Each sound is accompained with a label showing in sync with it's start.

They are either uncompressed or in ADPCM, which the
gstreamer-backend doesn't suport yet

sdl sound handler plays this fine (doesn't need --enable-mp3)

gst sound handler is currently unable to play this, but it's being worked on.

= [clip_as_button.swf] =

== Origin == 

== Description ==

Displais two circles on top and two circles inscribed into two rectangles
on the bottom. A textfield centered on the bottom is used to print
events.

The circle on top-left is yellow and reacts to mouse button press by
changing color to gray and printing "movie clip pressed" in the textfield.
(it's a movieclip, most likely)

The circle on top-right is blue and reacts to mouse button press by
changing color to green and printing "button pressed" in the textfield.
(it's a button, most likely)

The rectangle on bottom-left is light blue and reacts to mouse button press by
printing "big movie clip pressed" in the textfield. The circle inscribed
in it is yellow but doesn't handle mouse events itself, so clicking on
it does the same thing as clicking in the rectangle that contains it.

The rectangle on bottom-right is light blue and doesn't react to mouse button
press. The circle incribed in it is yellow and react to mouse button press
by changing color to a kind of dark cyan and printing
"small movie clip pressed" in the textfield.

Self-made by Udo Giacomozzi, Gnash developer

== Description ==

Various tests to check correct rendering of non-solid fill styles.
Check with gradient-test.png for a correct rendering.

First row: Linear gradients.
Left: simplest linear gradient, black to white, no transform
Center: Two additional color stops to get a very sharp border. The fill
  is also shrinked and rotated. This shows if the transformation matrix
  works correctly and if gradient overflow is correct (continue with
  first/last color, don't repeat the whole gradient). The two red 
  lines show where the color transitions should be. 
Right: Gradient with many color stops (red lines show transitions). 
  The shape is non-rectangular but the gradient has no transformation
  matrix.

Second row: Radial gradients.
Left: simplest radial gradient, black to white, no transform
Center: Six color stops added to the previous sample with red
  lines showing where they should be. The gradient is not centered.
Third: Simple radial gradient, but scaled (shrinked). Shows gradient
  overflow, which should be white. The dashed red line shows where
  the gradient ends (more or less).
Right: Gradient with four color stops, rotated and scaled.

Third row: Bitmap fills.
Left: Simple, scaled bitmap. No rotation.
Second: Slightly rotated bitmap (test anti-aliasing)
Third: Horizontally flipped bitmap
Last: Curved shape with bitmap fill. The fill is rotated and shrinked.
  The bitmap should be repeated and the blue corners shows the position
  of one sample tile.

Bottom row: 
Left: Highly scaled 4x4 bitmap. Shows resampling quality.
Right: Same scaled 4x4 bitmap and a linear gradient on top of it. The
  gradient has the same blue tone though the LUT but with decreasing
  alpha value.

= [subshapes.swf] =

== Origin == 

Produced by Udo Giacomozzi, gnash developer.

== Description ==

This is a test for shapes and the new_shape flag. Flash always tries
to combine multiple layers to one single shape if possible (when the
keyframes match and no dynamic objects are contained). To ensure the
correct Z-order while drawing it inserts a flag in the stream that
marks the switch to a higher layer. In Gnash, this flag is found in
the "path" class named "m_new_shape". The first path always has this
flag set.

The test contains three layers: Two rectangular shapes and a middle
layer with a red line. The line must be covered by the blue rectangle
but not by the gray rectangle.
