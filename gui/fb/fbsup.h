/// A Framebuffer-based GUI for Gnash.
/// ----------------------------------
///
/// This is a simple "GUI" that works with any framebuffer device (/dev/fb0).
/// No window system is required, it will run straigt from a console. 
///
/// The current version requires that your system boots in graphics mode (that
/// is, with a framebuffer driver - like vesafb - and most probably the 
/// virtual console enabled). Which graphics mode Gnash runs in depends on the 
/// mode your machine boots in and can be choosen using the kernel command line.
/// With other words: Gnash does not change the graphics mode.
/// Refer to the framebuffer docs for more information.
///
/// The fb gui now also supports pointing devices like mice or touchscreens, but
/// it is not required. It works with /dev/input/mice so any PS/2 compatible 
/// mouse should do. Your kernel can emulate the "mice" device for other devices
/// (like touchscreens and tablets) so this method is very flexible.
///
/// There is currently no visible mouse pointer built in, which is fine for 
/// touchscreens but will make it difficult for standard mice. This will be 
/// fixed in near time.
//
// Supported graphics modes:
///
///   Resolution: any
///
///   Pixel formats:
///     8 bit: none yet
///     15 bit: R5/G5/B5
///     16 bit: R5/G6/B5
///     24 bit: R8/G8/B8, B8/G8/R8
///     32 bit: R8/G8/B8/A8, B8/G8/R8/A8
///
///
/// Supported input devices:
///
///   any PS/2 compatible mouse (may be emulated by the kernel) talking 
///   to /dev/input/mice
