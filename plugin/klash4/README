Klash is a plugin for Konqueror, using the gnash binary from the Gnash
project. As of this writing, you can only get it by checking it out their
CVS repository. It should be newer than 2006-02-23, because that version
has the -x option to embed in a window.
You also need automake/autoconf and the SDL development.
