    <span class="application">Gnash</span> is a free SWF movie player.  It is available as a
    stand-alone application or as a plugin for several popular
    web browsers. It supports playing media from a disk or streaming
    over a network connection. Some popular video sharing sites like
    YouTube are supported on a wide variety of devices from
    embedded ones to modern desktops.
  </p><p>
    <span class="application">Gnash</span> has a better focus on security, allowing the user tight
    control of all network or disk based I/O. Gnash also supports
    extending ActionScript by creating your own classes. You can write
    wrappers for any development library, and import them into the
    player much like Perl or Python does.
  </p><div class="sect1" title="Audience"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="audience"></a>Audience</h2></div></div></div><p>
      This manual is primarily focused on users interested in how to
      get Gnash installed from a package, and basic usage as a web
      browser plugin. For more technical details, please refer to the
      Gnash Reference manual.
    </p></div><div class="sect1" title="What Is Supported?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="runs-on"></a>What Is Supported?</h2></div></div></div><p>
      Gnash is known to compile for most any POSIX and ANSI C++
      conforming system if you have all the dependent libraries
      installed. Systems we test on, and which Gnash is known to
      run on are Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
      Win32, and Darwin (OSX) primarily. Occasionally other platforms
      are built, primarily by those distribution maintainers. This
      includes BeOS, Haiku, Syllable, OS/2, Solaris, Slackware, and
      Gentoo.
    </p><p>
      Gnash is capable of reading up to SWF v9 files and opcodes,
      but primarily supports SWF v7, with better SWF v8 and v9
      support under heavy development. Since the 0.8.2 release,
      Gnash includes initial parser support for SWF v8 and v9.
      Not all ActionScript 2 classes are implemented yet, but all of the
      most heavily used ones are. Many ActionScript 2 classes are
      partially implemented; there is support for all of the
      commonly used methods of each class.
    </p><p>
      Gnash has implemented about 80% of ActionScript v2.0, and has
      begun implementing ActionScript v3.0. Gnash supports the
      majority of Flash opcodes up to SWF v9, and a wide
      sampling of ActionScript classes for SWF v8.
    </p><p>
      As ActionScript 3 is a more developed version of
      ActionScript 2, many of the same classes work for
      both. Support has been added to Gnash's ActionScript library
      to support the new ActionScript 3 filters, which get applied
      to every class. Implementing ActionScript classes is often the
      easiest way for new Gnash developers to make a contribution
      without a deep internal knowledge of Gnash.
    </p><p>
      Gnash has included video support since early 2007, but this is
      an ever changing field of reverse engineering. Many of the
      popular video sharing sites use SWF v8 or v9, which Gnash
      supports imperfectly. This is improving all the
      time, so often builds from a development snapshot will work
      when using the older release packaged in your distribution
      doesn't. You can find daily snapshots of the latest CVS tree
      at: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots/" target="_top">
      http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots</a>.
    </p><p>
      Gnash uses FFmpeg for codecs, so any file supported by Mplayer
      should work with Gnash. Gnash supports the loading of patent
      free codecs like Ogg Vorbis or Theora from disk based files,
      while work is being done to support these codecs when embedded
      in a SWF file. FFmpeg contains the codecs used by the current
      SWF defintion, FLV, VP6 (ON2), H.263, H.264, and MP3.
    </p></div></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter 2. Using Gnash"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="usage"></a>Chapter 2. Using <span class="application">Gnash</span></h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#options"><span class="application">Gnash</span> Command Line Options</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#keys"><span class="application">Gnash</span> Interactive Control Keys</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#gnashrc">User Configuration File</a></span></dt></dl></div><p>
    When used as a standalone player, you can play any SWF file from
    the command line by entering a command of the format: 
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      gnash <em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;option&gt; &lt;flashfile.swf&gt;</code></em>
    </pre><p>
    The only required argument is the name (and location) of the file
    to be played. 
  </p><p>
    The available options are listed in the following section, or you
    may view them in the terminal window by executing the following at
    the command line: 
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      gnash --help | less
    </pre><p>
  </p><p>
    The source code download of <span class="application">Gnash</span> includes several example SWF
    files.  They are located in the
    <code class="filename">testsuite/samples/</code> directory of the <span class="application">Gnash</span>
    source directory.  If you have installed <span class="application">Gnash</span> correctly, issuing
    a command similar to the following plays a short animation of
    a car swerving and crashing: 
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      gnash
      /home/<em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;username&gt;</code></em>/gnash/testsuite/car_smash.swf 
    </pre><p>
    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/car_crash.png" align="middle"></div><p>
  </p><p>
    The above is useful for playing Flash files downloaded to your
    local system.  It is also possible to play Flash files directly
    from the web.  To do so, use the <code class="option">-u</code> option along
    with the URL of the desired file. 
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
      gnash -u http://example.domain.com/flashfile.swf
    </pre><p>
    Note that this will not work with every website; some embedded
    Flash files are difficult to play. 
  </p><div class="sect1" title="Gnash Command Line Options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="options"></a><span class="application">Gnash</span> Command Line Options</h2></div></div></div><p>
      No options are required for  <span class="application">Gnash</span>'s default behavior.  However,
      there are many options that can be used to change that behavior.

	One of the goals of Gnash is to make it portable enough to
	install on small devices.  As a result, the hardware
	requirements are minimal. Gnash has even run on an ARM9 at 200
	MHz with 32 MB of RAM! (It ran without video support in this
	case.) While firm minimums have not been established, Gnash
	has been shown to run successfully with the following:

	The 0.8.8 release of Gnash has been designed to run on
	UNIX/Linux variants, and has been run on most of the free ones.
	However, Gnash has successfully run on Windows, Darwin (Mac OS X),
	Irix, Solaris, BeOs, OS/2, and Haiku.  Gnash has also run on the
	following 64-bit systems: PowerPC, Itanium, UltraSparc, and AMD64.
	For now, it is important to be sure that the following code, testing,
	and documentation dependencies are met before installing Gnash.  If
	you will be downloading Gnash with a package manager, these
	dependencies may be solved by the package manager.  Otherwise, you
	must first verify that each of these dependencies are installed on the
	target system.
      </p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Downloading Gnash"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="downloading"></a>Downloading Gnash</h2></div></div></div><p>
	There are two ways to download Gnash: using a package manager or by
	downloading the source code and building it on your system. If
	possible, it is advisable to use a package manager to download Gnash,
	as it will resolve dependencies for you.  However, if you want the
	very latest features, or a Gnash package is not available for your
	operating system, it is better to download the source code and build
	Gnash locally. 
      </p><div class="sect2" title="Getting the Source"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gettingsource"></a>Getting the Source</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Gnash is available as a <a class="link" href="#sourcereleases" title="Releases">release
	  tarball</a>, a <a class="link" href="#sourcerepo" title="Repository">development 
	  checkout</a>, or a <a class="link" href="#sourcesnapshot" title="Snapshot">development
	  snapshot</a>.
	</p><div class="sect3" title="Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sourcereleases"></a>Releases</h4></div></div></div><p>
	    The source can be acquired from a
	    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html" target="_top">GNU FTP
	    Mirror</a>.  The release version is intended to be
	    stable, and is probably your best choice if the release took
	    place recently.  If you need features or fixes which were
	    introduced after the release, consider a 
	    <a class="link" href="#sourcerepo" title="Repository">CVS checkout</a> or the
	    <a class="link" href="#sourcesnapshot" title="Snapshot">daily snapshot</a>.
	  </p><p>
	    To download, select a mirror near you, then choose the
	    <code class="filename">gnash</code> directory.
	  </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Snapshot"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sourcesnapshot"></a>Snapshot</h4></div></div></div><p>
	    The daily development snapshot can be downloaded from
	    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots/" target="_top">http://www.gnashdev.org/dev_snapshots/</a>.
	    This is the best option if you need changes which were introduced
	    after the <a class="link" href="#sourcereleases" title="Releases">last release</a> of
	    Gnash, but are unable to <a class="link" href="#sourcerepo" title="Repository">download
	    directly from the repository.</a>
	  </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sourcerepo"></a>Repository</h4></div></div></div><p>
	    The latest development sources are available via
	    anonymous CVS.  This is recommended
	    if you need features or bug fixes which were introduced after
	    the <a class="link" href="#sourcereleases" title="Releases">last release</a>.  Look at
	    the <a class="link" href="#sourcesnapshot" title="Snapshot">daily snapshot</a> if you
	    experience difficulty accessing the repository.
	  </p><p>
	    To download via anonymous CVS, first set the
	    environment variable <span class="command"><strong>CVS_RSH</strong></span> to
	    <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>, then check out the source code.
	    The example below uses the GNU Bourne-Again shell (bash): 
	  </p><pre class="screen">
	    export CVS_RSH="ssh"
	    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gnash co gnash
	  </pre><p>
	    It is also possible to browse the repository
	    <a class="ulink" href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/gnash/?root=gnash" target="_top">http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/gnash/?root=gnash</a> on the web.
	  </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Codec Support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="getcodecs"></a>Getting Codec Support</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Gnash requires codec support to handle audio and video
	  correctly. Some platforms like Ubuntu or Fedora under the
	  GNOME desktop will automatically notify the user that the
	  proper codecs aren't installed, and pop up a dialog box to
	  let the user download the codecs Gnash needs to make site
	  like YouTube work correctly. If you have installed Gnash on
	  any other platform, and video doesn't work, it's highly
	  likely you need to install the proper codecs. For most
	  platforms, this is the Gstreamer-ffmpeg plugin, available
	  from your distributions repository.

    The Gnash project relies on the community of Gnash users to test
    the player.  Feedback is critical to any successful project.  Not
    only does it let us know that people use Gnash, but it helps us  
    understand the community's needs. Gnash uses a bug tracker on
    <a class="ulink" href="http://savannah.gnu.org" target="_top">http://savannah.gnu.org</a> to manage these reports.
  </p><p>
    When filing a report, please follow the guidelines below. The better
    your bug report is, the easier it will be for the developers to
    address the issue. Bug reports without enough information will
    be asked to provide this information anyway. Adding
    critical details, like the Operating System you are on, its
    version, and any relevant error messages from Gnash that you get.

      For starters, it's a good idea to obtain a copy of the latest
      snapshot. Although Gnash is primarily released as source, the
      Gnash build infrastructure allows the automated building of
      binary packages. Often the version of Gnash as packaged by a
      GNU/Linux or BSD distribution is based on the last official
      release, which could be months out of date. It helps us, if
      this is the case, for you to try a newer packaged build of Gnash. 
    </p><p>
      You can get a fresh binary package of Gnash, as well as recent 
      source packages from
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.getgnash.org/packages/" target="_top">
	http://www.getgnash.org/packages

      Search the <a class="ulink" href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=gnash" target="_top">Gnash
      bug tracker</a> to see if the bug has already been identified.
    </p><p>
      If the issue has already been reported, you should not file
      a bug report.  However, you may add some additional information
      to the ticket if you feel that it will be beneficial to the
      developers.  For instance, if someone reported a memory issue
      on Ubuntu GNU/Linux, and you noticed the same problem on OpenBSD,
      your stacktrace would be useful.  Conversely, adding a "me too"
      note to a feature request is not helpful.

      A good bug report should be precise, explicit, and discrete.
      This means that there should be just one bug per ticket, and
      that a ticket should contain the following information:

	FrameBuffer
      </dt><dd><p>
	  In Gnash, this is a GUI library that outputs directly to the
	  Linux Frame Buffer and so does not need a window system to

	Gstreamer
      </dt><dd><p>
	  Gstreamer is a multimedia framework which Gnash can use for
	  decoding audio and video. Gstreamer itself cannot decode
	  anything, so it needs some appropriate decoding-plugins to do
	  the work for it. Remember to install them if you use Gnash
	  with Gstreamer enabled. To get the best out of Gnashs
	  gstreamer-parts, it is recommended to install the

      GUI
    </dt><dd><p>
	A <span class="emphasis"><em>GUI</em></span> is a 
	"graphical user interface". In <span class="application">Gnash</span>, the GUI 
	library provides a wrapper for mouse and keyboard events,

	OpenGL
      </dt><dd><p>
	  OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a standard specification
	  defining a cross-language cross-platform API for writing
	  applications that produce 3D and 2D computer
	  graphics. Accelerated graphic cards usually provide OpenGL at
	  the hardware level. Please refer to Wikipedia for availability

	  The <span class="emphasis"><em>renderer</em></span> is the subsystem of <span class="application">Gnash</span>
	  which renders content.  Only one renderer may be used; it is
	  selected at configuration time if building from source.
	</p><p>
	  Available renderers are: AGG, OpenGL, and Cairo. In terms of 
	  feature completeness, AGG comes first; followed by OpenGL and 
	  then Cairo. In most cases, AGG is preferred for performance, 
	  except cases where it is beneficial to have hardware accelerated 
	  rendering (for example, when you have a very slow CPU but a very 
	  fast graphics card). In this case OpenGL should be used.

      </p></dd><dt>
	RTMPT
      </dt><dd><p>
	  RTMPT is basically a HTTP wrapper around the RTMP protocol
	  that is sent using POST requests from the client to the
	  server. Because of the non-persistent nature of HTTP
	  connections, RTMPT requires the clients to poll for updates
	  periodically in order to get notified about events that are
	  generated by the server or other clients.  
	</p></dd><dt>
	RTMPTS
      </dt><dd><p>
	  RTMPTS is the same as RTMPT, but instead of being a HTTP
	  wrapper, it is a HTTP SSL wrapper (HTTP secure connection). 
	</p></dd></dl></div><div class="glossdiv" title="S"><h3 class="title">S</h3><dl><dt>
	SDL
      </dt><dd><p>
	  Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia free
	  software library that creates an abstraction over various
	  platforms' graphics, sound, and input APIs. Gnash can use it
	  as a GUI and/or as a sound handler. Note that the two usages
	  are independent of each other: you can use it for a task and
	  not for the other if you wish.  This version of Gnash does not
          implement menus in the SDL GUI; the SDL sound handler is the
          most feature rich, supporting video through FFmpeg. 
	</p></dd><dt>
	sound handler
      </dt><dd><p>
	  The <span class="emphasis"><em>sound handler</em></span> is the part of <span class="application">Gnash</span>
	  which handles both event sounds and streaming sound.  Audio
	  from external sources is sent through the sound handler
	  when SDL is used.  The sound handler must be selected during
	  configuration of Gnash when compiling.
	</p><p>
	  There are currently two sound handlers available in <span class="application">Gnash</span>:
	  FFmpeg and Gstreamer.  The ffmpeg sound handler uses SDL for
	  mixing.
	  The Gstreamer-sound handler uses the available 
	  plugins to decode the audio, so it might not work if some 
	  important plugins are missing.  The GST sound handler is 
	  recommended (the default).

	  The Tamarin project seeks to create an open source

	  In Flash technology, a timeline is a sequence of "frames". A

      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or

      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
      commercially or non-commercially. Secondarily, this License
      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
      their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.
    </p><p>
      This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
      that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in
      the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License,
      which is a copyleft license designed for free software.
    </p><p>
      We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
      free program should come with manuals providing the same
      freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited
      to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
      regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a

      The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
      text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts,
      in the notice that says that the <a class="link" href="#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this
      License.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-transparent"></a>
      A "Transparent" copy of the <a class="link" href="#fdl-document"> Document</a> means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available
      to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited
      directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
      images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for
      drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is
      suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
      translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
      whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
    </p><p>
      Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
      plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
      format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
      standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human
      modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
      proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
      and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the
      machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for
      output purposes only.
    </p><p><a name="fdl-title-page"></a>
      The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
      title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to
      hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
      the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title
      page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the
      most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.

      You may copy and distribute the <a class="link" href="#fdl-document">Document</a> in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
      applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
      you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
      License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
      control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
      distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
      copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
      must also follow the conditions in <a class="link" href="#fdl-section3" title="3. COPYING IN QUANTITY">section 3</a>.
    </p><p>
      You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated
      above, and you may publicly display copies.

      If you publish printed copies of the <a class="link" href="#fdl-document">Document</a> numbering more than 100,
      and the Document's license notice requires <a class="link" href="#fdl-cover-texts">Cover Texts</a>, you must enclose
      the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
      Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also
      clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
      copies. The front cover must present the full title with all
      words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
      limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
      <a class="link" href="#fdl-document">Document</a> and satisfy these
      conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.
    </p><p>
      If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
      adjacent pages.
    </p><p>
      If you publish or distribute <a class="link" href="#fdl-transparent">Opaque</a> copies of the <a class="link" href="#fdl-document">Document</a> numbering more than 100,
      you must either include a machine-readable <a class="link" href="#fdl-transparent">Transparent</a> copy along with
      each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
      publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added
      material, which the general network-using public has access to
      download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network
      protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
      reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
      copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
      remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
      year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly
      or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
      public.
    </p><p>
      It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
      of the <a class="link" href="#fdl-document">Document</a> well before
      redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance
      to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
