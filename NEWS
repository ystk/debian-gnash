Gnash 0.8.5 released !
Improvements since 0.8.4 release are:

Due to better XML parsing compatibility and a minor fix to NetConnection,
many more video sites work than in the last release. Support for new
codecs keeps YouTube support up to date.

XML parsing, Selection implementation, Sound and MovieClip fixes mean
that many BBC Flash movies (not the BBC iPlayer) now work.

Potlatch support is improved with better remoting compatibility and
XML parsing.

All of the Orisinal morning sunshine games now work due to support for
Mixed SWF Versions runs.

    * Support for saving streamed (FLV, H264, MP3 etc) and loaded (JPEG,
      SWF, PNG, GIF) media to disk.
    * Basic GUI warning messages when media decoding fails (usually
      missing codecs).
    * Added support for FLV parsing and decoding of H.264 video and
      AAC audio.
    * Scaled video smoothing implemented in AS and in default renderer
      (AGG). YouTube video looks better when Gnash is running with high
      quality or better.
    * Support for _quality implemented with user-specified
      override. (Presently only affects video smoothing in the default
      renderer).
    * Made NPAPI plugin quiet, except on plugin-specific errors (to
      reduce .xsession-errors pollution).
    * Implemented LoadVars.toString(), XML.send() and LoadVars.send().
    * XML parsing made compatible (less strict), XML.xmlDecl and
      XML.docTypeDecl implemented.
    * XMLNode methods implemented: getPrefixForNamespace(),
      getNamespaceForPrefix(), namespaceURI, localName, prefix. Handling
      of attributes corrected.
    * New GUI for KDE4 / Qt4 with SWF properties and Gnash preferences
      dialog boxes.
    * Corrected AS enumeration order.
    * Fixed incorrect mouse event on double click (shouldn't exist).
    * Implemented MovieClip.getURL(), MovieClip.attachBitmap().
    * Implemented POST for send() and getURL() methods.
    * Added support for parsing and decoding Speex audio in FLV files
      using libspeex.
    * __resolve property implemented. Fixes a Flickr Flash badge.
    * Video.clear(), Video.width and Video.height implemented.
    * Multiple NetStream.play() fixed.
    * Fixed support of mixed-version swf runs.
    * Fix decoding of RAW and UNCOMPRESSED audio with gstreamer media
      handler
    * Improve SWF4 compatibility.
    * Improve compatibility in setting characters properties.
    * NetConnection.isConnected and NetConnection connect events
      implemented (fixes various video sites).
    * Remoting support generally improved (NetConnection).
    * Make initialization object available to MovieClip constructor
      (attachMovie, duplicateMovieClip).
    * Sound.getBytesLoaded, Sound.getBytesTotal implemented.
    * Complete Selection class implemented.

Sixth alpha release of Gnash (0.8.4).
Improvements since 0.8.3 release are:

More visible to users:

    * The -d switch won't behave the same as in 0.8.3. This is a
      temporary thing, we'll likely bring it back to its original
      behaviour for next releases. If you're curious, -d will now
      change heart beating rate.
    * Support for MIT SHM X extention is disabled by default `cause
      it broke (*grin*). We'll get it back on next release. Let us
      know if you really notice a performance degradation on the
      rendering side please <gnash-dev@gnu.org>. 
    * Keep Adobe happy with our users and our users happy with us by
      changing "Flash player" into "SWF player" everywhere.  Adobe
      claims "Flash" as a trademark and had asked a Linux distributor
      to fix it.
    * The popular SWF Twitter badge now renders correctly.
    * Fix parsing of urls containing multiple question marks 
    * Fix support for movies embedding multiple sound streams 
    * Support for loading PNG and GIF images added.

      changes listed below.
    * Support for writing RGB/RGBA PNG images and JPEG images.
    * Works with Potlatch OpenStreetMap editor
    * New 'flvdumper' utility for analyzing FLV video files.
    * XPI packaging support for Mozilla & Firefox. 

Less visible to users:

      o flash.display.BitmapData partially implemented.
      o flash.geom.Transform.matrix and flash.geom.Transform.ColorTransform

        MovieClip transformations.
      o Playback of VP6F video (SWF version 8 FLV) with Ffmpeg. 
    * Fixes and implementation of ActionScript 2 classes:
      o NetConnection.call() implemented: initial support for flash Remoting
      o toString() method of objects called correctly, String.split
        implementation fixed.
      o XMLSocket onData method implemented properly, other methods fixed.
      o Error class implemented.
      o XML and LoadVars sendAndLoad() now derive from a common base object
        (loadable AS object); fixes the popular SWF Twitter badge.
      o addRequestHeaders and contentType implemented for LoadVars and XML. 
    * VM bugfixes and improvements:
      o Heart beating model, allowing for fine-grained interval timers and
        threading reduction.
      o Frame label fix (case sensitivity).
      o Fixes and improvements to Color and cxform.
      o SWF matrix made faster and more compatible (golf.swf works now!)
      o try/catch/finally ActionScript expression handled more correctly.
      o Parse and partially use ScriptLimits tag. Handle stack limit more
        correctly.
      o Fixed scoping issues for SWF <= 5
      o Bitmap characters now support alpha.
    * Media handling improvements:
      o Pluggable architecture for MediaHandlers (ffmpeg/gst available)
      o Media-handler agnostic Sound and NetStream classes
      o Numerous bug fixes in ffmpeg and gstreamer media handling
    * SWF version 2-specific fixes:
      o PlaceObject tag display fixed (also applies to SWFs generated with
        some free tools)
      o DefineButtonCxform tag implemented). 
    * Codebase improvements:
      o Renamed the 'server' directory to be a more accurate 'libcore'.
        Merge 'libgeometry' into 'libbase'
      o Keep Adobe happy with our users and our users happy with us by
        changing "Flash player" into "SWF player" everywhere (a Linux
        distributor received a demand letter).
      o Numerous cleanups and changes to improve portability.

    * Streaming video works with YouTube and Lulu.tv! This has been the
      focus for the majority of the time since the last release.
