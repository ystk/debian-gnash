    files into debian/patches to do so:
     - do-not-delete-gmo-files: one-liner to avoid the deletion.
     - series: restored series file since there was none left.
    (Note: po/Makefile.in not patched since it is removed by the clean rules,
    the patch wouldn't apply if it were modified.)
  * Updated debian/copyright from GPLv2 to GPLv3 (copyright blurb), and added
    a versioned dependency on base-files to ensure that the GPL symlink points
    to the appropriate version, as reported by Robert Millan (Closes: #441019).

gnash (0.8.1~rc.070818-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Miriam Ruiz ]
  * debian/control: point Xs-Vcs-Bzr: to Debian release branch
    http://bzr.debian.org/bzr/pkg-flash/debian.sid
  * debian/control: break long Build-Depends line into multiple lines
    for the sake of readability
  * debian/patches/use_pkglibdir_for_unversioned_libs, debian/patches/series:
    remove upstream applied patch 'use_pkglibdir_for_unversioned_libs' from bzr
    and quilt series.
  * debian/patches/ming_headers.patch, debian/patches/no-kde-ldflags
    debian/patches/exclude-testsuite-from-built: Removed unneeded patches
  * debian/rules: make errors in make clean fatal
  * debian/rules, debian/autogen.sh: Added script to regenerate the autotools
    building system in case it's not present in the tarball
  * debian/gnash-common.install: Install libraries whether they're CVS version
    or not.
  * debian/rules, debian/gnash-dev.install: Removed references to gnash-dev, as
    it's not predictable to exist in a near future.
  * debian/rules, debian/*.install: Modify source so that files to be installed
    can be referenced from debian/ directory without having to move them.
  * debian/overrides/* : Added override files for lintian warnings
  * debian/rules: Comment out dh_makeshlibs, as we're not releasing any public
    shared library anymore.
  * debian/rules: Don't copy files from debian/ into debian/tmp: not needed
    anymore.
  * debian/*.desktop: Fixed desktop files.

  [ Alexander Sack ]
  * debian/control: choose sane explicit depends: 'gstreamer0.10-plugins-base,
    gstreamer0.10-videosink | gstreamer0.10-plugins-good,
    gstreamer0.10-audiosink | gstreamer0.10-alsa'; promote
    gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3, gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg to recommends as
    debian has no easy-codec-install backend (yet); fix short
    description typo.
  * debian/patches/disable-testsuite: gnash builds now fine without
    hacking build system to not include testsuite in build
  * debian/patches/series: drop this patch from quilt series file
    accordingly.

gnash (0.8.1~trunk.070802-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  Update source for trunk build 070802 aka preview 0.8.1:
      bzr repo: https://code.launchpad.net/~vcs-imports/gnash/trunk
      revno: 5534
  
  Redo and cleanup packaging in consequence of upstream buildsystem
  refactoring:

  * debian/rules: dropping obsolete --enable-sound and --enable-mp3 and
    the bogus --enable-static switch; fixing --enable-gui switch
  * debian/patches/series: don't apply no-kde-ldflags anymore ... applied
    upstream
  * debian/patches/series: don't apply easy-codec-install anymore ... applied
    upstream
  * debian/rules: use agg renderer
  * debian/patches/{disable-testsuite,series}: disable testsuite patch
  * debian/control: drop firefox-dev from build-depends
  * debian/patches/*: drop ming headers patch - not used
  * debian/rules: use enable-gui='gtk,kde'
  * debian/rules: dropping obsolete --enable-sound and --enable-mp3 and the
    bogus --enable-static switch; fixing --enable-gui switch
  * debian/patches/use_pkglibdir_for_unversioned_libs, debian/patches/series:
    install libs in pkglibdir instead of just libdir - as they are unversioned
  * reorganize gnash packaging to take upstream changes into account:
    all common files are now stored in pkglibdir and provided by gnash-common 
    package; in turn no libgnash0 nor libklash0 package exist anymore; gui
    code is not linked into the binaries, which are provided by gnash and klash
    package respectively; since no stable lib api is provided anymore
    libgnash-dev package is now just gnash-dev (though its currently disabled
    completely).
  * debian/gnash-common.install: install those libs we need explicitly to
    prevent libgnashplugin.so from getting pulled into gnash-common package
  * debian/rules: don't run dh_makeshlibs for libgnash0 libklash0 anymore ...
    as they don't exist
  * debian/control: make gnash-common conflicts/replaces on libklash0,
    libgnash0, gnash << 0.8.1~
  * debian/gnash.manpages: remove manpages for gnash package as gnash manpage
    is now shipped in gnash-common
  * debian/TODO,debian/overrides/libgnash0,debian/overrides/libklash0:
    dropping these old/unused files from bzr.
