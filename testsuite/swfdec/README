This directory is contain scripts to run swfdec trace-based testsuite.

The PASSING file is a list of SWF files in the testsuite which is expected to pass,
associated with their md5sum.
When new tests are, or existing tests are updated, they'll be expected to fail by default.
If you see an unexpected success you can add the name and md5 of the file to PASSING.
Please keep the file sorted by name.

The REALTIME file is a list of SWF files that load external resources. 
These files are run with the nominal FPS to give the loading threads
more chances to load the resource within the expected frame number.

You'll need to pass the --with-swfdec-testsuite switch to configure in order
for swfdec tests to be run as part of the 'make check' rule.

Have fun.
