This directory is used as input for the misc-ming.all/SharedObjectTestRunner
script. Files here will be copied to a player's SOLDIR and the SharedObjectTest.swf
will be played, containing tests for reading the sol files.
Finally on player exit the script checks if the sol file was written and if it
matches the input one.
