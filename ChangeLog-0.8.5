2009-03-09  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	Moved ifdef's around

2009-03-08  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	Since this function is empty (at least) Apple GCC 4.2 fails to call it, making it noinline fixes the issue

2009-03-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Keep OpenSolaris build happy

2009-03-07  John Wimer  <john@god.vtic.net>

	Corrections to findText implementation.

2009-03-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename and re-scope some types.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop typedef from fn_call.h.

2009-03-05  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	look for lber still, ubuntu seems to need it.

2009-03-05  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	don't access _pollfds if poll.h isn't found

2009-03-05  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	look for the the poll.h and epoll.h headers, as some platforms implement this entirely in a header file, so looking for the function in the library fails.

2009-03-05  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	look for just uic too for qt4 builds.

2009-03-05  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	Get VM from fn_call.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests for TextSnapshot.
	
	Rework so that a pointer to all static Text character is kept in
	TextSnapshot_as. This is necessary for highlighting, which will
	require either access to the TextRecords or transform information (or both).
	
	Implement getText() and getCount() properly.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement TextSnapshot constructor. This isn't ideal, but like many other
	classes works for the majority of cases.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Check that TextSnapshot can't be constructed with a string arg either.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add virtual getStaticText() to character class for retrieving a string from
	static text fields.
	
	Add virtual extractStaticText() to character_def for querying definitions for 
	static text.

	Add MovieClip::getTextSnapshot() to query the display list for static text,
	which is then added to a string.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement reverse lookup in code table, that is, return the unicode character
	of a given glyph. This is for TextSnapshot, which is certainly implemented
	as a special class/method of MovieClip because doing this is inefficient.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Code cleanups.

2009-03-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-03-04  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	look for moc in addition to moc-qt4. fixes #25758.

2009-03-04  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	improve test for broken floating point.

2009-03-04  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

2009-03-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	If mallinfo is used whenever HAVE_MALLINFO is defined, it also has to be
	linked.

2009-03-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix mallinfo linker flags for libbase/gmemory.h, which is built automatically
	when HAVE_MALLINFO is defined. Fixes OpenSolaris build, though it might
	also be better to make this part optional.

2009-03-04  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

2009-03-02  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Prevent the plugin from spawning two processes for the same movie.

2009-03-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Send event on gui-initiated fullscreen.
	
	Minor cleanups.

2009-03-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Set fullscreen via core. This is necessary because many video players change
	form when they receive a Stage display state event (onFullScreen). Pressing
	escape on YouTube fullscreen now restores the widgets correctly.
	
	This also now applies to the fullscreen option from the Gnash menu for the
	same reason. It potentially reduces user control by notifying actionscript
	on every change, so may be revised if it makes Gnash less useful.
	
	Rename enums, minor cleanups.

2009-03-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use ctor initializers properly. Don't reimplement vector::erase().

	Give full visibility to the remaining objects that are thrown across DSOs.

2009-03-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't forget to assign super in function.apply(). Fixes YouTube fullscreen
	button and new mtasc tests. Thanks to Michael F?tsch for identifying the bug.

2009-03-01  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test super() behaviour with function.apply() (gnash fails)

2009-02-28  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	IOException is thrown across DSOs so it must be exported, or it won't be
	caught. See http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility .

2009-02-27  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	fix minor typo in dumpconfig message.

	Changes to allow compilation with OpenSolaris: include correct header
	for finite(); Use 'struct utsname' instead of 'utsname'; be consistent
	with fixed-size int type usage.

2009-02-26  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	rearrange headers, and move oputside the name space so swscale functions actually get found at link time.

2009-02-25  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	rearrange header order to fix build on mips.

2009-02-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	choke on them.
	
	Add missing return.
	
	Break some long lines.

2009-02-25  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	patch from Paul Smedley so OS2 builds.

2009-02-25  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Fixing bug #25670 (Gst/MP4 contained AAC audio doesn't play):
	
	* libmedia/gst/MediaParserGst.cpp: Only search for a parsing element if
	the GstCaps indicate that the demuxer has done no parsing or framing.
	* libmedia/gst/swfdec_codec_gst.{c,h}: Allow sink pad connection method
	to be called with either a GstPad or a GstElement. 

2009-02-25  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	Indentation.

2009-02-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove PP_COMPATIBLE_DEVICE_FONT_HANDLING macro. Because at least one
	prominent case relies on this 'bug' (YouTube), it's no longer optional.
	The other strange behaviour of device fonts (rotation) is not implemented.

2009-02-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correctly render device fonts with parent cxform. Fixes YouTube 'recently watched' widget

2009-02-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove duplicate definition of SwsContextWrapper after merge from
	release branch. It is now back in the implementation file, because there's
	no benefit to having it in a header unless that header is included by all
	places that use SwsContextWrapper (e.g. VideoDecoderFfmpeg).

2009-02-24  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	merge from release branch.

	Merge fix to leak in gst codec information from trunk.

2009-02-24  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Advertise XVideo support on 'make dumpconfig' when built-in (only for GTK gui atm)

2009-02-24  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	don't try to run the testsuite for distcheck, we do that as a separate step.

2009-02-24  John Wimer  <john@god.vtic.net>

	Remove the requirement of the browser being gtk2 based. It's no longer needed.
	This allows QtWebKit to embed the gnash plugin (gtk and kde4 both work)

2009-02-23  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	fix typo so VideoConverterGst.h gets included in the dist tarball.

2009-02-23  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add system header for compilation on OpenBSD.

2009-02-23  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Oops, I broke builds *with* media in last commit, now fixed

2009-02-23  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix build w/out media handler, and avoid aborting as a consequence (no media => no sound)

2009-02-23  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	drop unused methods

2009-02-23  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Dunno why close() was commented out, later test for state==CLOSED obviously failed like that

2009-02-23  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	XV support, part 2.
	
	macros/x11.m4: Look for the Xv library and header file.
	gui/am-frag/gtk.am: Build Xv if it's availabe on the system.
	libbase/rc.{cpp,h}: Add "XVideo" boolean setting for gnashrc.
	gui/gtk.cpp: If Xvideo is available and enabled in gnashrc, try to use
	it and fall back on normal rendering if that fails.
	gui/gtk_glue_agg_xv.{cpp,h}: Xv glue implementation that originates from
	the proof-of-concept patch by Craig Kelley <namonai@gmail.com>.
	gui/gui.h: Remove unused method.

2009-02-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Prevent illegal read if the AMF buffer isn't long enough for an
	advertised NUMBER type. Fixes a memory error in test_rtmp (hex7,
	line 729). Why it isn't long enough is another matter, but we should
	be able to deal with corrupt AMF data anyway.
	
	Make indentation more consistent within the file.

2009-02-19  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	merge from release branch test case improvements.

	make sure kde3,kde4 test works on OpenBSD 4.4.

2009-02-19  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	make sure one has the proper development versions of kdelibs, as on Debian
	derived distributions, you can only have either kde3 or kde4 installed, not
	both. This still allows one to build both kde3 and kde4 on other distributions
	at the same time if kde3,kde4 is specified. Fixes Bug #25613.

2009-02-19  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	don't look for libber.

	uninitialized values and absent return value.

2009-02-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix warnings, use typedefs and a function object for clarity. Add assertion

	move rtmp_server from libnet to cygnal, as it's becoming less generic, and more cygnal specific.
	check the threading flag from the config file. If in single threaded mode,
	all RTMP packets are processed in the one function, as there is no distpatch

2009-02-16  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	This is a normal case, since we check many places for an RC file.
	So don't complain bitterly every time we run gnash! 

2009-02-16  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	Added licensing + code refactoring(Vitaly liked structs, I prefer pure C++-classes)

2009-02-15  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	make snapshot-deb a phony target, and add dependencies.

2009-02-15  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	building debs almost works again.

2009-02-14  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

2009-02-14  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	Get xpi packages to build again, but using the snapshot-* targets.

2009-02-14  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	add yum info for missing packages instead of just .deb ones.

2009-02-14  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	Update current translation files.

2009-02-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove Swedish translation. There were only four strings translated into

	was in German or not done at all, and the character encoding was wrong.
	
	It will be less work to start a new translation than keep that one.

2009-02-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Create gnash.pot in the source directory, where xgettext looks for it.

2009-02-11  John Wimer  <john@god.vtic.net>

	streampos where necessary.

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Silence Machine warnings resulting from commenting out a hackish and
	obstructive use of fn_call().

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Wide-ranging but generally minor changes to align interfaces and documentation,
	move local functions out of class definitions, clean up GTK code and make
	variable names shorter to reduce the number of very long lines, and
	make access route to VM simpler.

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Further clean up.

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	yet working) disabled code for quality settings. Don't log on resize_view
	any more, as there doesn't seem to be a bug here.

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Corrections to curl_adapter types.

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Formatting.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make getting VM from fn_call easier. Hold environment by reference.
	
	Reduce calls to VM::get() by getting it from other places.
	
	Give PropertyList a _vm member.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make getting VM from fn_call easier. Hold environment by reference.
	
	Reduce calls to VM::get() by getting it from other places.
	
	Give PropertyList a _vm member.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Reduce VM singleton use, drop unused step/jump menu methods because they
	use VM::get() and are all disabled.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add TODO.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor refactoring and formatting.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make IOChannel implementations reflect the documentation more. Drop
	error codes for a boolean bad(). Use streamsize for bytes written to / read
	from streams, streampos for positions, and size_t for stream size, which
	is logically correct, consistent, and reduces unnecessary casting.
	
	Silence plugin debugging again.
	
	consumeInput() should also apparently update bytesTotal.

2009-02-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation.

2009-02-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add video codec information to gst when codec construction fails. Include
	warning about gstreamer-ffmpeg when the codec is FLV or h264.

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add an optional error() function to the AbstractIFaceCallback for
	sending important errors to the hosting application.
	
	Report media decoder creation problems to the hosting application.
	
	Pop up a window in the GTK gui warning about problems. This is quite helpful
	for ffmpeg, not very helpful for gstreamer (no codec information).
	
	Allow turning off GUI popups in the rc file.

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rework NamingPolicy to use base URL for ease of finding saved media.
	
	Move StreamProvider and NamingPolicy functionality out of the core to the
	hosting application to keep libcore clean. Improve interfaces.

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop obsolete code from GTK gui, revert some unfinished work on GTK gui that
	wasn't intended for committing.

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	StreamProvider owns the NamingPolicy object (no obvious need for
	shared ownership).
	
	Add NamingPolicy files.

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move NamingPolicy to its own files in libbase.
	
	StreamProvider is no longer a singleton and must be passed to the RunInfo.
	The NamingPolicy for cache files may be passed to the StreamProvider (either
	in the ctor or using setNamingPolicy()).
	
	RunInfo pointers are now shared_ptrs to signify shared ownership; this
	reduces the importance of construction/destruction order and should
	make future refactoring easier.
	
	LoadVariablesThread takes a StreamProvider in the ctor in order to fetch
	its stream.

2009-02-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update pre-built moc file for kde4, or it won't link when the moc

	Prevent abort on apparently poorly-formed embedded MP3.

2009-02-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop apparently wrong assertion that the decode will always consume what's
	passed to it if there's no error.

2009-02-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Stop glyph count corrupting terminal output.

2009-02-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Patch for hiding the menubar in standalone Gnash.

	Rename no-menu to hide-menubar, as it doesn't hide the right-click menu.
	
	Drop mystery 'm' option.

2009-02-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add no-menubar option

2009-01-31  Markus Gothe  <nietzsche@lysator.liu.se>

	Fixes issue with path-traversion

2009-01-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Allow users the option of saving loaded or streamed media, currently 
	using a fairly rudimentary an inflexible system of naming files.
	
	The naming system will be improved by using a functor, and the naming
	code may be moved somewhere more suitable.

2009-01-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add an overwrite-existing naming policy.

2009-01-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	else eventually.

2009-01-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split saveMedia into saveStreamingMedia and saveLoadedMedia. Save in
	directories based on hostname.

	Write values to rcfile, correct typo.

2009-01-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	rcfile values properly.

2009-01-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Allow saving cached media streams permanently on disk (NetConnection
	only at present).
	
	RcInitFile support for target directory and on/off toggle.
	
	GUI support for turning on/of and setting target directory.

2009-01-22  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Use boost::bind instead of binder2nd to avoid a reference-to-reference

	Implement _quality and _highquality for TextField and Button. 
	Passes in actionscript.all. Expect one failure, as it was only passing
	because unimplemented; now it fails for the same reason as other
	prototype (non-)properties.

2009-01-22  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups.

2009-01-22  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	Drop some unused code.

2009-01-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct quality override.

2009-01-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Movie Quality enum to gnash.h so it's easier to share.
	
	Add an override for quality, using -1 for the AS / SWF quality setting,
	otherwise a permanent manual override.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement and test _quality and _highquality, currently only settable from
	MovieClips. There is presently no manual override, but this will be trivial to
	implement.
	
	Implement Video.smoothing, which makes YouTube look more attractive in 
	the AGG renderer. Because this also depends on the _quality / _highquality
	setting, it can still only be set via ActionScript.
	
	Tidy up render_handler.h. Since the Gnash VM will have to be more closely
	integrated with the render_handler, new code is not in the proxy
	libcore/render.h, but rather in render_handler.h.
	
	Remove anti-aliasing flag and other related, renderer-specific enums from
	the render_handler base class- Renderers should now query the _quality
	member when deciding how to render; details of how they do it should
	be kept internal and not pollute the renderer API.
	
	Use a new VideoRenderer class in the AGG backend for drawing video frames. This
	may be used to keep instances alive across frames if necessary. Its interface
	needs more improvement. 

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Silence debugging.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Video.smoothing and Video.deblocking shouldn't be read-only. Fixes
	YouTube (and any other SWF using smoothing).

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update drawVideoFrame signature.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement Video.smoothing, and only use high-quality interpolation when
	smoothing is requested and quality is HIGH or BEST.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix OGL build again.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix testsuite run again.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement _quality for MovieClips (not yet Buttons or TextFields), 
	correct initialization order in agg (hard to spot these errors amongst all
	the agg warnings).

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improve _highquality getter/setter, test _quality.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Introduce VideoRenderer class.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cleanup.

2009-01-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Start implementation of a quality setting. Clean up render_handler header
	so it looks more like an interface.

2009-01-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another OpenBSD build fix and some tests for blendMode confirming the
	way it was implemented was correct (large numbers do not truncate).

2009-01-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add some more tests for blendMode argument, and cast to int before casting
	to BlendMode because OpenBSD's compiler can't do double to BlendMode.

2009-01-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix build on OpenBSD, add missing include in Global.cpp.

2009-01-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add the HitTests test.

2009-01-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Ignore _root transform for getWorldMatrix when doing pointInBounds test.
	Do this by supplying an extra argument to getWorldMatrix (default true) for
	whether to concatenate the Stage transform.
	
	Add new HitTest tests. Gnash now passes most, and bowman.swf works
	(bug #21588 fixed).

2009-01-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	New HitTest test in actionscript.all.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Numerous AS fixes for 26 new swfdec testsuite and some actionscript.all
	passes.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Finish documentation.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add pass in swfdec.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Always start the NetStream advance timer, so that status notifications
	are always sent. Pass in swfdec testsuite.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Break long lines, especially long comments appended to lines of code,
	which are annoying and horrible.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean ups.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cosmetic change.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Register LoadVars.decode as an ASnative, move to LoadableObject, and drop
	type checking. Passes in swfdec testsuite.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Line breaks.

2009-01-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Assign correct "this" in function apply() calls undefined or non-object
	first argument.
	
	The only remaining failure in function-apply is the fact that arrays can't
	be faked in Gnash.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	function-apply-5.swf passes now the whole trace is compared.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Modify sed script so it doesn't drop half the lines from
	function-apply-?.out.swf.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct prop flags for "extends". SWF5 still fails, probably because of
	prop flags when looking up constructor and __proto__.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct Error implementation. Passes in actionscript.all.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split long lines.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Prefer valueOf over toString for all objects when comparing as_values where
	this is an object. Fixes ActionNewEquals for dates in SWF6+, and some
	swfdec testcases.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make leap years calculation more readable and do what it's supposed to.
	
	Handle setYear arguments properly.
	
	Passes in actionscript.all, and 8 more swfdec passes.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Do doubleToString better in as_value. Move dox to header.
	
	Check Date.setTime() arguments better, so that swfdec test passes.

2009-01-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More sensible name.

2009-01-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move number conversion into separate functions so it can be used for
	parseInt too.

2009-01-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add a couple more tests in Number.as (all passing).

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't leak LoadVariablesRequests when finished with.

2009-01-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Updated Finnish translation

2009-01-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Check that getBytesLoaded/getBytesTotal simply return the value of _bytesLoaded and _bytesTotal, which exist right after a call to load (for both LoadVars and XML objects)

2009-01-10  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	XML test: check that _bytesLoaded and _bytesTotal are set by XML.prototype.load call; use hasOwnProperty in SWF5 too; fix run with SWF8

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	return NaN from Math.pow if first arg is not finite: fixes math-function tests from swfdec

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Use the versioned to_string for String.concat. This was easy. Why isn't to_string *always* versioned btw ?

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Properly support hex and oct input for string-to-number, fixing tests in ours and swfdec testsuite

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	ActionScript / VM corrections, various swfdec and actionscript.all test
	passes.

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Mouse is always initialized as an AsBroadcaster. Prop flags should take care
	of access for SWF5 and below.
	
	Correct Mouse prop flags.

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	New test passes.

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Retrieve Math args in the correct order (affects valueOf call order), always
	convert first two arguments, even when there are 3 or more, and convert
	arguments to Math.random() as well, even though both are unused.
	
	Passes swfdec tests.

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Handle std::pow correctly.
	
	The swfdec math-function test now passes except for std::pow(Infinity, 0.4)
	and std::pow(-Infinity, 0.4), which are apparently supposed to return NaN.
	The pp LNX 9,0,115,0 returns Infinity, however, which also is what Gnash does.

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Prefer conversion to number on ActionNewLessThan, or comparison of
	Date objects fails.

2009-01-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make Math.min() and Math.max() (without arguments) return the correct value.
	
	Math.round() also calls valueOf on an unused second argument, if present,
	so we use a UnaryMathFunc and push it in the template like the rest.

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	skip *spaces*, not *blanks* -- fixes also an swfdec testcase

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	don't copy character bounds while rendering

2009-01-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	swfdec math-actions.

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make XML errors compatible (according to the swfdec testsuite).
	
	Correct ActionDivide when dividing by 0.

	Handle division by 0 compatibly (and C++ standard compliant).

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Report missing closing tag. Tests in swfdec testsuite now pass (xml-error)
	for versions 7 and 8. The earlier version fail due to the string_table
	case bug.

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	An empty tag counts as unterminated, and therefore malformed XML.

2009-01-08  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Split long action buffers and lines therein, should fix bug #25139

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor corrections to XML / XMLNode; some test passes.

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Corrections to XML parsing and XMLNode output (escape attribute values).

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Replace action_type with ActionType in debugger too. Thanks to
	Michael F?tsch for pointing it out.

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix memory corruption on XML parsing that was causing occasional crashes
	running the swfdec testsuite. Strange that it hasn't been noticed before.
	
	Just catch expected exceptions on function execution, or such errors can be
	hidden.

2009-01-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	AS corrections, some swfdec test passes.

2009-01-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2009-01-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Prop flags of _customHeaders.

	Modifications to TagLoadersTable. Use SWF::TagType for the table key,
	as that's enforced for the loader_function anyway.

2009-01-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename tag_type enum to TagType and action_type to ActionType.
	Use SWF::TagType everywhere instead of sometimes int.

	Remove libmedia dependency on libcore. Fix metadata handling crash
	(bug #22868). Minor modifications, with documentation, to libmedia interface
	and removal of VM functionality to libcore.

2009-01-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move typedefs to MediaParser class.

2009-01-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Dox, quieten debugging.

2009-01-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Replace MetaTag struct with a simple multimap of timestamp to buffer. Transfer
	tags to NetStream_as before executing, and move execution to libcore instead
	of libmedia. This removes libmedia's dependency on libcore for this purpose,
	and more importantly fixes a crash when a metadata function triggers the
	destruction of the FLVParser.
	
	Make readAMF0 const correct, update all callers.
	
	Register Date prototype with VM using addStatic, which fixes a crash in
	AMF parsing (Date construction).
	
	Don't use the VM's RNG in AudioDecoderNellymoser. It's not thread-safe, and
	creates an unnecessary dependency.
	
	Remove libmedia's dependency on libcore for win32 (should now build without).

2009-01-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Have isFLV throw an IOException when not enough bytes are available for
	reading. Add exception specification, document and catch it. Throw 
	MediaException not GnashException on other libmedia errors.
	
	Split long lines.

2009-01-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Line breaks.

2009-01-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rearrange header.

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop stuff.

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups.

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	It seems this was deleted when resolving a conflict.

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test and fix Date encoding with overridden valueOf().
	
	Fix memory corruption (GC) on exit with SharedObject::flush().

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another SOL test.

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test a Date with overridden valueOf. Use Date_as::getTimeValue() instead.

2009-01-02  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Flush SOL files when the SharedObjectLibrary is cleared, not in
	the dtor of SharedObject_as, due to GC issues. Delete the SharedObjectLibrary
	before GC::cleanup() is called for similar reasons. Add VM::clear() method
	for doing this.

2008-12-31  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename Date to Date_as, clean it up, and move the class definition
	to the header for use in AMF decoding.
	
	Add new test to SharedObjectTest, which makes Gnash fail a seemingly
	unrelated assertion in action.cpp.

2009-01-01  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Implement and test encoding/decoding of LONG STRING amf0 type. pp 10 for lnx fails, pp 9 and gnash succeed.

	Don't create a new renderer at each character drawing

2008-12-31  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	apply_matrix_to_path: don't allocate double as many paths for each shape

2008-12-31  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	netstream-onmetadata.swf also passed, due to the AMF0 Date decoding...

2008-12-31  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Corner cases in comparison opcode, fixes relational-#.swf tests of swfdec, from version 5 to 7 (all).

2008-12-30  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix encoding/decoding of DATE AMF0 to include timezone (always 00, as documented).
	Force use of GMT for SharedObjectTestRunner.sh, which is the only case in which
	pp *really* uses 00 as documented. Disable debugging enabled by last commits.

2008-12-30  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Export TZ to GMT-1 while running the SharedObjectTestRunner, as that's the timezone the sol file was produced in, and interpretation of it is assumed from -- TODO: better handle predictibility, further inspect TZ effects on encoding

2008-12-30  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add AMF encoding/decoding for Date objects, and test for it in SharedObjectTestRunner.
	NOTE: bitwise comparison fails due to different ending.
	Proprietary player now ends it with FF C4 00 while gnash keeps ending it with 00.
	No idea how much this is related to Date itself (timezone info ?)

2008-12-30  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Make the result of MEDIA(something) quoted, to avoid problems with swfc when special characters are found in MEDIADIR path

2008-12-30  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Kde4 gui: correctly compute redraw area; show/hide mouse cursor; keyboard handling and Esc to exit fullscreen.

2008-12-30  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Complete adding Element-based tests in test_encoding

2008-12-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove some UB, should fix behaviour on ARM platform.

2008-12-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove unreliable conversion from utility.h, move local functions from
	SWFMatrix header to the cpp file. One unreliable conversion function
	remains in SWFMatrix.cpp.

2008-12-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2008-12-29  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	KdeGlue.h doesn't exist, is Kde4Glue.h for kde4-gnash

2008-12-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Silence warnings for unused variables. Define PATH_MAX whenever not defined,
	as not even POSIX systems are bound to define it. Make the hard-coded length
	a bit less mean (1024 instead of 255). Fixes build on GNU/Hurd.

2008-12-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make constructing a string a bit simpler.

2008-12-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update event_id callers.

2008-12-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename event_id functions, provide read-only accessors and make data
	members private. Other minor refactoring.

2008-12-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a map for event_id<-->function name and event_id<-->function key so
	that it doesn't tend to break every time something changes.

2008-12-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move array.{h,cpp} to libcore/asobj/Array_as.{h,cpp} so it can be with

	Don't include array.h in FLVParser.

2008-12-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Merge from kde4 branch. The option --enable-gui=kde now takes 'kde3' instead.
	To build kde4, use '--enable-gui=kde4'.
	
	There may be build problems with kde4, as it hasn't been widely tested.
	Reportedly kde4-gnash segfaults on at least one platform.
	
	The criterion for the merge is that kde3 and the default configure still
	work as before.
	
	Fix for default configure by setting build_qt3 as well as build_kde3 when no
	guis are specified.

2008-12-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	macros into their own files. This reduces complexity for the obscure
	differences between how these 3 packages get installed by variious
	distributions. 

2008-11-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2008-12-17  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	There's no remoting_end.as anymore, sorry

2008-12-17  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Make the remoting test sensitive to OUTPUT_VERSION, build in version 7 by default (an array length changes semantic based on that)

2008-12-17  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add test for how floating number index affects length in SWF before and after version 7

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Restore useful comment removed in a fit of deletion.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor fixes.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Buttons can be placed with an initObj, so don't abort.
	
	Remove logging.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cut down LocalConnection logging.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Explicitly override pointInShape to use pointInBounds for Bitmap, as they
	should be the same.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement MovieClip.attachBitmap().
	
	As only BitmapData.fillRect() is implemented, this isn't very exciting. The
	most common use - BitmapData.draw() - needs renderer support.
	
	Change some of the render_handler interface (render.h interface is unchanged),
	and reduce memcpy in agg.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add copyright information.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't unregister Bitmap, as it causes memory errors. Use the
	stagePlacementCallback to register the bitmap, as it's not guaranteed that
	the Bitmap character will be placed, and that would be a waste.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix ogl properly.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Modify create_bitmap_* functions in ogl and cairo to match agg.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop templated agg_bitmap_info. Drop separate create_bitmap_info for
	rgb and rgba, as it's not hard to work it out.
	
	Don't abort() after return, as I don't think returns in C++ are generally
	thought to need a fallback.
	
	Don't copy the image data when we can take ownership of it.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the unimplemented method for drawing MovieClips onto a Bitmap. It
	just needs the data and more testing now.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Override virtual method for rendering to an image. Not implemented.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add virtual method for rendering MovieClip to a bitmap. Not implemented.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Convert GnashImage to BitmapInfo straight away, as there isn't any
	advantage to delaying it. Drop _image member.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use typeName for nicer display. Drop comment about inheritance.

2008-12-17  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Separate drawing and finalizing. Cache width and height as they are
	constant and used frequently.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cleaning up.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add debugging to MovieClip.attachBitmap.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix segfault, various other improvements. misc-ming.all/BitmapDataTest.swf
	passes visually now.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rough and unoptimized implementation of MovieClip.attachBitmap().

2008-12-16  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	automake 1.9.6 doesn't provide a 'builddir' variable, so don't rely on it

2008-12-16  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add --enable-http-testsuite directive to configure.
	When enabled, make check will also run a remoting test against a service
	on gnashdev.org. You can specify another uri for offline testing.
	Updated remoting.README with more info about how.

2008-12-16  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Another remoting test, for multiple args

2008-12-16  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Have the remoting server return number of arguments passed, test passing no args at all

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cut out one of the classes involved in bitmap storage and display.
	Preparatory to implementing MovieClip.attachBitmap.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop commented-out code.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop bitmap_character_def, which wasn't a character_def, as it's silly to
	use two ref-counted classes in parallel for the same thing. Use BitmapInfo
	(was: bitmap_info) on its own instead.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor changes.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Early returns, drop unused code, improve formatting.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove as many DSOEXPORTs as possible.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Gut bitmap_info.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Line length.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Reduce duplication in DefineBits parsing.
	
	Adjust existing RGB values when merging alpha to jpeg data. Fixes
	bugs #23131, #21818, part of bug #20257, and the bad rendering
	in bug #24201.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the std::min of alpha and the respective pixel value, which makes lumi.swf
	display correctly.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Complete removal of code duplication. DEFINEBITSLOSSLESS2 (with alpha) and
	pixel format 4 seemed wrong, as alpha was stored to the first byte of
	every pixel. Gnash expects RGBA. This is now changed, but I have no
	examples of such a tag in any SWF for testing.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Premultiply alpha when adding to jpeg images, as all other bitmaps are
	expected to have premultiplied RGB. Fixes the bad alpha display.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More code reduction.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Progress.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Start cleanup of define bits tag parsing.

2008-12-16  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Restore nuked comment change.

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Hold a *list* of AMFQueue objects, each for each connection.
	Fixes the "connect opens a new connection" testcase.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	NetConnection.connect() calls close(). NetConnection.close() does nothing
	if not connected. Improve tests, add more notes.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests and improved implementation.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Close existing connections. Test close() better, and drop the silly
	_inError member that was there due to misintepretation of the tests.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test onStatus calls better. Start testing return from call().

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	URL dox.

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Improved remoting test to also check number of connections engaged.
	Gnash passes those!

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Test that every new 'connect' resets the call ids, no matter if the connection was to the same uri

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	fix explanation of what is failing with the only failure

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update NetConnection comments and tests.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Comments, make NetConnection test more accurate.

2008-12-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop old or unused code.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop generic_character::get_character_def(), which wasn't used, and quite
	right too.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop commented-out memcpys.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop some more stuff.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop enclose_own_bounds, which isn't used, implemented or documented.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move character constructor to the cpp file to save rebuilding, and because
	there's not much advantage having it in the header.

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add checks for request id

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	add request_id to info returned by remoting server

2008-12-15  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	add checks for hex encoding and remote method name

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	change the hard-coded url of the remoting tester to gnashdev.org

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add the server side of the remoting test, and a short README about it

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Build remoting test so it can connect to network even when run from filesystem, have it dump player version.

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Initial test client for jason's remoting tester

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Don't override user-defined custom headers for the sake of "Expect:" stripping.
	Instead, merge the user-defined and our own, letting user overrid Expect if she's willing to.
	Also, fix leakage of user-defined headers.

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Don't allow ActionSetVariable and ActionSetMember to use empty strings for variable/member name, and log an ASerror if it is attempted.

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add an isStrict() method to Array_as; add an allowStrictArray method to
	as_value::writeAMF0; Have SharedObject encoding disallow encoding of STRICT_ARRAY
	and NetConnection allow it. Fixes writing lines with potlatch.

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Strip Expect header also when sending custom headers

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Don't add a NetConnection call id when callback is  undefined (TESTED)

2008-12-14  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add what would be the perfect candidate to be encoded as a STRICT_ARRAY, and test that it's still encoded as an ECMA_ARRAY instead.

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	visit values in enumeration order. fixes the SharedObject write test. BINARY COMPATIBLE NOW!

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Have visitProperties use enumeration order. Makes the sol1.sol file
	closer to correct version. Next mismatch is handling of movieclips.

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	typos in amf serialization debugging prints

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Move stream creation logic from NetStream to NetConnection (will be useful
	for RTMP).

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	MovieClip.startDrag and MovieClip.stopDrag have been tested enough

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Don't limit the size of a NetConnection.call reply.
	Reallocate the reply buffer as needed, in chunks of 200kb.

2008-12-13  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Instruct libcurl NOT to send an Expect: header, as some older http servers choke on it.
	In particular, the lighthttp version used by openstreetmap.org had the problem, and this patch fixes potlatch for me.

2008-12-12  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	log once about unimplemented cacheAsBitmap

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor fix to Button properties, various AS tests.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Line breaks, indentation, typenames.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement Button.enabled as a normal, overwritable property.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tidy up AsBroadcaster, add some more tests.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix to SharedObject name.

2008-12-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test and validate SOL names. Clean up some code.

2008-12-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop the slash.

2008-12-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cosmetic change.

2008-12-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't return a SharedObject when an impermissible path is requested. This is
	the proper fix to the SharedObject.as test failures introduced yesterday.

2008-12-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add tests and correct implementation for SharedObject path.
	
	Adjust misc-ming.all SharedObjectTestRunner.sh now that Gnash does the
	same as the pp.

2008-12-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Treat the localPath argument to SharedObject.getLocal() correctly. It
	must be part of the SWF path.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More SharedObject fixes.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Always initialize data member on readSOL (unless exception thrown, which is
	an untested case). Make data a getter/setter. Passes another test.
	
	Expect failures due to a SharedObject not being null when it should be. This
	wasn't what the test claimed it was doing, and isn't a regression.
	
	Flush on exit. This *must* happen, so if it does cause memory errors as 
	a comment suggest it used to, it has to be fixed in a different way from
	just dropping it.
	
	SharedObject.flush() can take an argument, so log unimplemented.

2008-12-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix extention code

2008-12-09  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add TODO item

	quality std classes, fixing build on debian lenny

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Various fixes to SharedObject AS compatibility.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Comment.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Various cleanups.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use a scoped_array for the buffer. Make the readSOL more readable.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Invalid SOL files act the same as non-existent ones. Only files with
	a header and no data end up with no data member.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Return undefined from SharedObject.flush() when there is no data member.
	Alter SharedObject::flush() to take the data object as an argument to
	facilitate this.
	
	Add some tests.
	
	Add PROP_DATA to namedStrings.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Comments and tests on ASnative SharedObject.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Stub unimplemented undocumented methods of SharedObject. Tidy up. Correct
	prop flags. Don't initialize data member until a SharedObject instance
	exists, and even then not if the SOL file existed but was invalid.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up Object class.

2008-12-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cleanup Object.{cpp,h}, and don't pass as_objects by auto_ptr.

2008-12-08  Benjamin Goose  <benjamin@localhost>

	Add missing comma.

2008-12-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop some return values, note why others are useless.
	
	Minor corrections to AS correctness, swfdec testsuite passes.
	
	General clean up.

2008-12-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test Object.addProperty() return, confirming that we don't care about
	the result of as_object::add_property. Make as_object::add_property
	void (instead of always returning true).

2008-12-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop old code.

2008-12-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove unused methods. Ignore the return value from
	PropertyList::addGetterSetter, add comments explaining why, and what it
	did before. Don't pass namespace as an as_prop_flags argument.

2008-12-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rearrange String_as. String.concat doesn't have to be applied to a
	String_as, despite what my comment from a while ago claims. Now passes 
	swfdec's string-fake and doesn't fail any actionscript.all tests, so the
	earlier conclusion must have been based on a bogus test.

	Tidy up code, rename some files and classes.

2008-12-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement AS side of MovieClip.blendMode. As Button and allegedly TextField
	can also use blendModes, the implementation may be moved to the character
	class.

2008-12-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test and implement AS MovieClip.blendMode setting.

2008-12-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Resolve the NetStream play() URL using the base URL, and do not play unless
	NetConnection is connected. Should fix a few video SWFs broken since last
	night's commit.

2008-12-04  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make sure NetStream URLs are constructed with the baseURL, and append to

	"file://")

2008-12-04  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Document AudioInfo.duration units; have FFMPEG media handler log an error
	when it can't find out; add duration print in easysound.swf.

	to be improved and turned into a self-contained one

2008-12-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2008-12-03  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Don't allow ActionGetVariable to return a MOVIECLIP type (they didn't
	exist in SWF4!). Might be a too-close-to-opcode fix, but was simple
	and effective it seems. Fixes tests in swf4opcode.sc, tests welcome.

2008-12-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix some typos in parseAttribute: unescape, not escape attributes;

2008-12-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test NetConnection.connect and onStatus event.
	
	Rearrange NetConnection class so it's a bit more organized (but still
	something of a mess).
	
	Make NetStream status codes use std::strings, implement some NetConnection
	codes the same way (but without queueing). Currently only the connect
	status code is properly implemented, but this fixes video playback 
	in bug #19844.

2008-12-03  strk  <strk@gnash>

	_level0 is also undefined in swf4

2008-12-03  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Silence some debug logging.
	
	Drop onSetFocus and onKillFocus functions from TextField as these
	are now handled in movie_root.

	from the default implementation in character. Don't remove focus on unload.
	
	Implement Selection.addListener, correct onSetFocus, onKillFocus events.
	
	Don't allow Buttons to receive focus, as it causes a test to fail. According
	to docs, they are able to, but this isn't yet tested.

2008-11-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split long lines.

2008-11-27  strk  <strk@gnash>

2008-11-27  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Separate PlayHead from NetStream, worth using in Sound too.

2008-11-27  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Reduce (virtual) function calls in mergeAlpha().

2008-11-27  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Tab to spaces

2008-11-27  strk  <strk@gnash>

2008-11-26  strk  <strk@gnash>

	use the swf6flags, nothing fails, nothign succeeds either, but since the flag was there, there must have been a reason

2008-11-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix unused variable warning. Split long lines.

2008-11-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix availability of initObject properties in constructor by passing the
	object to (all) stagePlacementCallback() functions and re-arranging
	MovieClip:::stagePlacementCallback().
	
	Add some sort of implementation of getBytesLoaded and getBytesTotal for
	Sound objects. It's not fully correct, but perhaps someone will look at
	it now.

2008-11-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test passes.

2008-11-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass initObj to stagePlacementCallback so properties can be copied between
	setting correct bounds (display list dependent) and calling the constructor.

2008-11-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Cleanups, move property copying to before attachCharacter.

2008-11-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2008-11-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop stuff.

2008-11-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix visibility build.
	
	Drop #defines in plugin.h.

	wrong code.

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Fix as_value::to_bool_v6, 2 more swfdec tests pass.

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

	distinction for SWF4.

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Test setProperty with "nan" strings. Gnash fails also for _visible,
	which bwy "fixed" recently.

	xpasses after typo fix

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

	don't call getStr() twice

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add tests for setting properties using undefined or other-nan values.
	Shows a bug in a deduction (to_number returning 0 instead of NaN for SWF4)
	and prevents regressions in the _xscale/_yscale case which fixed
	the 'around' orisinal game.

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

	don't check for undefined twice

2008-11-25  strk  <strk@gnash>

2008-11-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests for attachMovie initObj.

2008-11-24  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test that initObj properties should be available to the constructor
	used in attachMovie for SWF7. Warning: _height and _width are treated

2008-11-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make a start at rationalizing system header includes. Remove unused file.
	
	This may break some builds; every file with read() or write() should include
	GnashSystemIOHeaders.h. Missing includes for (only) those functions on a
	particular platform should be added to that header file and not put
	anywhere else in the code.

2008-11-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove unused xmlattrs.h.
	
	Handle read() and write() functions using the new GnashSystemIOHeaders.h

	files (should help relocating system includes to compatibility headers).

2008-11-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Improve prefix/namespace lookup model, and make sure the container isn't
	destroyed before using its iterator.

	check deleted sounds on fill.

	Patch adding boost namespace to stdint types and dropping unnecessary
	includes. Thanks to Tonko Juricic.

2008-11-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Apply patch from Tonko Juricic to enable libamf to build on msvc++.

	a different order).

2008-11-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test passes.

2008-11-21  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	is required. Fixes winterbell from orisinal.
	http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/00bells.swf

2008-11-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add a few more tests, minor corrections to XMLNode interface implementation
	and fix a silly typo in getNamespaceURI.
	
	Add more characters to URL::escape.

2008-11-20  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Const-correct get_exported_resource.
	Have Sound.attachSound lookup in the SWF movie containing
	the attachSound call, not top-level movie: only test was
	success or failure in looking up the symbol by
	http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/00bells.swf

2008-11-20  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Make VM SWF version modifiable during runtime, have ActionExec have it
	set to the SWF version of the "currently running code".
	Have ClassHierarchy always register classes, but using visibility flags
	to hide for older swf versions. 
	See http://wiki.gnashdev.org/Mixed_SWF_Versions for the why.

	Oops, the scope stack change broke all of actionscript.all... will need more tests to figure how things change

2008-11-19  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Sleep less while waiting for load of NetStream

2008-11-19  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Pushing the activation object to the scope stack depends on version
	of the SWF containign the function definition, not top-levels.
	This makes the bells fall down in
	http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/00bells.swf

2008-11-19  strk  <strk@gnash>

	print function pointer associated to action block when in a function (helps debugging)

2008-11-19  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add an optional callerDef member in fn_call, use that from builtin function to switch behaviour based on swf version

2008-11-19  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Expose SWF version of file containing action blocks, use that to
	switch behaviour in ActionStringLength and ActionNewAdd.
	This was tested, broader test show that this is needed for a lot more
	cases. The test isn't automated yet but is as simple as having an SWF7
	load any -v5 test in actionscript.all and see what fails (a lot does!)

2008-11-19  strk  <strk@gnash>

	SWF version dependent ActionStringLength. Not 100% correct, but gives 3 XPASS in swfdec testsuite

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Mark expected failures.

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Some tests for our sadly broken XMLNode attributes.

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests for attributes.

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement more XMLNode methods.

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Comments, test totals, rename XMLNode class to XMLNode_as.

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test and implement XMLNode.prefix and XMLNode.localName.

2008-11-19  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test getNamespaceForPrefix, getPrefixForNamespace, namespaceURI methods
	of XMLNode. Implement namespaceURI.

2008-11-18  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Fix parsing of URLs with a port number but no path component

2008-11-18  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Ah, found the offending url failure vi testsuite/libbase/URLTest.cpp 

2008-11-18  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add test for rtmp url (over paranoia, just that url didn't seem to work fine in the rtmp branch, so I was wondering

2008-11-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Always use a vertical box for the gnash window, embedded or not.
	Always add/remove the 'click to start' button to the vbox.
	Fixes bug #23477 and gives access to the right-click menu.
	Tests highly welcome. In particular, should be tested how the 
	movie info deals with "entity under the mouse" while paused 
	(window coordinates might be bogus)

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Corrections to and more implementation of XML methods.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test and implement XML.xmlDecl property.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add doctype to XML.toString output. Make XMLNode::toString virtual so 
	XML::toString is called. Implement docTypeDecl getter/setter.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add some tests for malformed XML. Get &quot; and &apos; the right way
	round.

2008-11-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Fix "click-to-play" for the standalone case. If you like it, we might
	use the same model for the plugin, as the bug (#23477) really seem
	to depend on the mechanism we use to show the button (no bug with standalone
	and this model)

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Silence more intrusive logging.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Quieten debugging.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add missing include.

2008-11-18  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	register movie definition with gui before calling createWindow, as
	the latter may want to use the former for resize events.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rewrite XML parsing.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Unused variables.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop another remnant of libxml.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop libxml includes from XMLNode_as.h

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Swfdec testsuite passes.

2008-11-18  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rewrite XML parsing, using swfdec's model as a base.
	
	This:
	- removes the dependency on libxml2
	- is less strict, so that we can parse XML incorrectly like Flash does
	- and consequently fixes many cases where an unescaped entity broke parsing
	completely.
	- parses directly into XMLNodes instead of first into memory
	- passes some more swfdec tests.
	
	Drop various unused functions and files. Rename enums to make it less ugly.
	Clean up.
	
	Remove libxml checks from configure.

2008-11-17  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add ABC_ACTION_END, 4-spaces tabs

2008-11-17  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Add output operator for abc_action_type enum

2008-11-16  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Fix warning (assigning -1 to unsigned int).

2008-11-15  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	libcore/as_value.{cpp,h}: Increase type safety by using templates to
	prevent implicit conversions to bool. This allows us to declare a
	single numeric constructor. As a side-effect, the compiler will
	refuse to compile as_value(NULL) or as_value(0) until you resolve
	the ambiguity.
	
	This commit changes all uses of as_value(0) and adds tests.

2008-11-15  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use numerical value instead of boolean for _visibility. Add tests. 
	Fixes bug #24839.

2008-11-15  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Don't hot-plug consumers for which a decoder could not be constructed.
	Should fix mx1 check with gst (that host fails creating an audio decoder
	for audio in square.flv)

2008-11-15  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Stop redeclaring isinf by renaming it to isInf (like we do for isnan).

2008-11-14  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Catch exceptions thrown by sound handler construction.
	Should "fix" bug #24834.

2008-11-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove empty file.

2008-11-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Const correct point_test_local, drop some unused code.

2008-11-14  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix for bug #24835 (don't forget addStatic() for the TextField prototype
	in SWF version 5).
	
	Some other things I thought I'd already committed.

2008-11-13  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rearrange MovieClip, add tests for unloadMovie(). This function should 
	clear any drawable while leaving the bounds (along with other properties)
	untouched. No more drawing can be done.

2008-11-14  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	libbase/utility.h: Stop including pthread.h inside namespace gnash,
	because this confuses platforms such as OpenBSD. We can now stop
	including pthread.h all over the place, which was a workaround
	for the former.

2008-11-13  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Use GdkImage instead of fiddling with MIT-SHM and Xlib directly.

2008-11-13  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Use GdkImage instead of fiddling with MIT-SHM and Xlib directly.

	No more need to sleep in order to fetch samples when using MovieTester

2008-11-13  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Use a NullSoundHandler for testing, and fetch as many samples as needed
	when advancing clock (need another pass to make it a stateful fetcher)

2008-11-13  strk  <strk@gnash>

	be nicer with make -j# check

2008-11-13  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Move most of sound_handler code to base class, leave to subclass
	actual mixing of input channels and eventually setup of thread-based
	fetching. Please test test test and report threading issues ASAP.
	I'll wait for dust to pose before next move, which would be predictable
	samples fetching for test runners.
	BTW, included in this patch is opening the audio on constructor
	of the SDL sound handler, so you'd get aborts even if there's no 
	sound in the SWF (expecting aborts from make check on mx1).

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct NetStream.play() implementation and add comment.

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove very annoying debugging line in TextField.
	
	Start new movie whenever play() is called in NetStream.

2008-11-12  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Update use of PNG flags and libs since change of the related GNASH_PKG_FIND invocation

2008-11-12  strk  <strk@gnash>

	SafeStack.h: style things, commented-out debugging line (now in sync with avm2 branch)

2008-11-12  strk  <strk@gnash>

	fix extraction of next available child depth

2008-11-12  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add the concept of "Stage childs" in movie_root, and expose addChild
	and addChildAt methods, to be used by SWF9 movies. AVM2 branch will
	use these initially, and I think we're getting close to the possibility
	of an avm2 merge to trunk.

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement more Video properties.

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop ogg width test, as gstreamer doesn't know the dimensions.

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initialize _width and _height.

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add a VideoDecoder::width() and VideoDecoder::height() as pure virtual 
	functions. Implement in Ffmpeg (working) and Gst (not yet tested).
	
	Test that Video.width and Video.height are 0 until decoding starts.
	
	Implement Video.width and Video.height.
	
	Limit lines to 80 characters.

2008-11-12  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Video width and height.

2008-11-12  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Stub unimplemented Video properties and modify the prototype when there
	is an embedded Video stream.
	
	Rearrange TextField.cpp.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rearrange TextField.cpp to keep class and AS interface functions together.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct Video test totals.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests for Video properties. Add deblocking, smoothing, width and 
	height properties to prototype only on construction of embedded Video
	stream.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More tests for Video interface.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement Video.clear(). Netstream_as has to expose its play state for this
	to work.
	
	Drop unused enum in Netstream_as.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test for Video.clear() on embedded video (should not have any effect).

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Implement Video.clear().
	
	Silence excessive TextField debugging.

2008-11-11  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor cleanups of formatting and code line length.
	
	Reorder TextField::format_text so it uses a simple switch statement. Drop
	the ugly use of goto. Drop unnecessary setting of TextRecord properties,
	and add some comments to explain what is going on.

2008-11-10  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Line break.

2008-11-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Minor formatting changes.

2008-11-09  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Finish main font parsing separation.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move all font parsing out of the Font class.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move most Font-related parsing to libcore/swf, so that the Font class
	is either constructed with an immutable DefineFontTag or from a 
	device font. The Tag-related part of the Font (embedded glyphs and
	records) is immutable. Device-font glyphs can be added on demand
	as before. There should be no reason to change the Font externally.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Dox.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Yes, it is possible for embedded fonts to be requested when there isn't
	one, so handle it gracefully.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	More renaming, and move more parsing to DefineFontTag.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename font to Font.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move DefineFont and DefineFont2 parsing into libcore/swf/DefineFontTag.{h,cpp}.
	A font can now be constructed only as an embedded font (with a DefineFontTag)
	or a device font (with name, bold, italic).

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up indentation, obsolete code, and rearrange font class.

2008-11-08  strk  <strk@gnash>

	updated

2008-11-08  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Don't forget AM_LDFLAGS (see bug #21536)

2008-11-08  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Don't throw an exception if no streams were found at construction time, it's not required anymore is it?

2008-11-08  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Fix an infinite loop in MediaParserGst constructor (probing). It should not even probe now, as isn't required, but I didn't want to change too much code so there are still unused things here and there most likely

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move DefineText parsing from all over the place to libcore/swf and use
	the new system for tag loading. Make TextRecord parsing more sensible
	and clean up rendering. 

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Remove Text, move display function to TextRecord.
	
	Make more tag constructors private so that they can only be constructed
	during parsing. Add some documentation.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Quiet logging.

2008-11-08  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct some typos, restore has{X,Y}Offset(). Testsuite now passes again.
	Everything seems in order.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Introduce TextRecord class for parsing and storing TextRecords (DefineText
	and DefineText2), and also for dynamic creation from TextField.
	
	Text.h and Text.cpp are almost useless now.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename text class to Text.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Transfer DefineText and DefineText2 parsing to swf.

2008-11-08  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Handle "aux" streamers using the sound::InputStream abstraction, change
	attach_aux_streamer to return an identifier to the new inputstream plugged

	Fix include.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move parsing of DefineButtonCxform tag outside of button_character_definition
	(though it still needs direct access to the button records). Rename stuff,
	make more things private, and provide accessors where necessary.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Consolidate parsing of SoundInfo records into one place (used in StartSound,
	DefineButtonSound, and (not implemented) StartSound2).
	
	Add StartSound2 and log unimplemented.
	
	Split parsing of DefineButtonSound from button_character_def and move into
	swf directory. Clean it up.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct typo.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add StartSound2Tag (for logging, not implemented).

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Construct StartSoundTag directly from a stream. Rename members of SoundInfo.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use SoundInfoRecord to parse a SoundInfo record.

2008-11-07  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split DefineButtonSoundTag parsing into a separate file. Clean it up and make
	access clearer.

	Rename video_stream_instance to Video.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Split video stream parsing into DefineVideoStreamTag and VideoFrameTag. Push the
	data in the frame tags to the DefineVideoStreamTag on parsing.
	
	Drop things from shape_character_def that aren't immediately useful. They 
	can easily be retrieved if necessary.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up shape_character_def so it's almost readable. Drop the debugging
	stuff, which almost certainly doesn't work any more.

2008-11-07  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Don't assume an as_value returning true from ::is_object() also returns
	non-zero from ::to_object(). It doesn't, when the as_value is a dangling

	Fix abort in delete2 and correct implementation after testing.
	
	TextField cleanup and implementation.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't build for earlier versions of ming.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Different behaviour according to version. All tests fixed, and so is the
	abort in http://bitstream.ca/mt/images/banner_v3.gif

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test malformed deletes. Fix abort and implement most of the delete
	modes. One failure on an odd result still.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Don't override get/set member for text or htmlText property. Return something
	for TextField.text and TextField.htmlText, though the first is definitely
	wrong and the second untested.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	misc-ming.all TextField pass (TextField.text implemented).

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update swfdec PASSING. Mostly new tests, three fixes from TextField.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Restore a (now optional) definition to the static TextField, as the default
	text appears to be immutable. The presence of a definition can be used to 
	distinguish between static and dynamic TextField. The updateText() function
	should apparently only restore the default text if there is a definition.
	
	TextField.variable returns null if the variable name is empty, which also
	happens when undefined or null is passed.
	
	Implement TextField.text setter.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix maxChars (it does not limit the length of the text, but is rather for
	limiting user input). Store defaultText so the testsuite passes again.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add the new tag parser.

2008-11-06  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Move DefineEditText parsing to swf/DefineEditTextTag and make consistent
	with the parsing style in that directory. Drop pointer to definition (now
	tag) in TextField, as there is nothing immutable.
	
	MovieClip now constructs the TextField character directly using a second
	constructor, instead of faking a definition first.

2008-11-06  Sandro Santilli  <strk@keybit.net>

	Update help message for --with-ffmpeg-incl to fix policy

2008-11-05  Russell Nelson  <nelson@crynwr.com>

	Use -o instead of '|| test'  for portability

2008-11-05  Russell Nelson  <nelson@crynwr.com>

	http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?6665

2008-11-05  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	fix bug with the latest ffmpeg svn installation craziness.

2008-11-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tweak TextField implementation, stub unimplemented methods.

2008-11-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Expect failures.

2008-11-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Correct totals.

2008-11-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Indentation and cleanups in TextField.
	Add new passes in TextField and toString_valueOf (TextField SWF5 prototype).
	There are new failures because some properties of TextField should not be
	defined before instantiation. They were undefined before because they were
	not implemented at all, so this seems acceptable.
	
	The problem now appears to be that the Dejagnu.swf clip trace field shouldn't
	be regarded as a TextField instantiation, but it is by Gnash, so the prototype
	is changed before it should be.

2008-11-05  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename edit_text_character to TextField.
	Add password, multiline and maxChars to TextField (not implemented).
	Change prototype of first instantiation of TextField, behaviour different
	for SWF5 and SWF6+.

2008-11-04  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	improve looking for avcodec.h.

2008-11-04  Rob Savoye   <rob@welcomehome.org>

	pass LIBAVCODEC_IDENT when compiling so --version gets the right value.

2008-11-04  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Base expected results on gprocessor runs, for make check's sake

2008-11-04  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Modify signature of the aux_streamer_ptr to be as expressive as an InputStream instance.

2008-11-04  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Define an eof() method for sound::InputStream, and stop using the return value of ::fetchSamples for that. Documentation updated accordingly

2008-11-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests for TextField.

2008-11-03  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Explode sound classes in their own files, fix a bug in the decoding
	loop.

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Explode few classes in their own files, fix a bug in the decoding loop
	for embedded sounds.

2008-11-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Finish comment.

2008-11-03  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Make sure the _stage is registered before calling stop(). This has the
	advantage of ensuring gtk is also ready, so that stopHook() should always
	work the first time, and also won't mess up the stage size. Add assertions
	to make debugging easier if something goes wrong.
	
	New swfdec tests pass.

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Documentation and logging improvements, always keep track of audio blocks in streaming sound.

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Always keep track of audio block sizes (not only for ADPCM), improve
	debugging logs

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	hopefully clearer message about possibly malformed audio block

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Don't pass a zero-bytes buffer to the decoder, instead log an error
	about not being able to isolate a frame from input data.

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	drop deprecation of SoundInfo (really reflects the way a sound is defined in an SWF); cleanup dox

2008-11-01  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Improve documentation for audio codec types

2008-10-31  strk  <strk@gnash>

	fix unused parameter warning

2008-10-31  strk  <strk@gnash>

	3rd cleanup phase for sound_handler:
	- Add fetchedSamples() interface to sound::InputStream 
	- Make EmbedSoundInst a proper class (mostly private) implementing sound::InputStream
	- Cleanups volume and envelopes application
	- Use more int16_t types, refer to data in "samples"
	- Documentation improvements, todo labels left here and there

2008-10-31  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Passes in swfdec testsuite.

2008-10-31  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test and implement __resolve property. Fixes the Flickr flash badge
	(example: http://www.widgetbox.com/widget/92061296-1f33-4713-bd33-11182bd5c7f5)
	(although the photos temporarily disappear when they should stay visible).

2008-10-31  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix warning.

2008-10-31  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Clean up.

2008-10-31  strk  <strk@gnash>

	slightly shorter names for classes, make EmbedSound a factory for EmbedSoundInst

2008-10-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Recommit strk's patch, because bazaar is too lame anything but the
	last commit.

2008-10-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Revert commit.

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Store in a boost::ptr_vector so we don't have to delete them manually.
	Document.

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Second cleanup pass to SDL sound handler, still trying to move toward using
	an InputStream for embedded sounds... will take 3/4 more passes I guess

2008-10-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Rename mouse_button_state.h to match the class name. Tidy up and
	rename Number to Number_as, in accordance with the as_object naming
	scheme.

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Have InputStream::fetchSamples return the number of samples sent to output buffer

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add throw specification

2008-10-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop something useless in array.h, add Sound tests.

2008-10-30  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Drop old stuff.
	
	Rename resource to ExportableResource and use dynamic_cast instead of
	reimplementing it.

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Ooops, these were part of the previous logical commit (renames)

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Some renames in sound_handler_sdl, toward turning former active_sound (now EmbeddedSoundInstance) into an InputStream..

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Define a sound_handler::InputStream abstract class to use for plugging
	input channels to a sound_handler (to be renamed sound::Mixer). No
	implementations yet, but the plan is to turn both "aux" streamers and
	"active_sound" into subclasses of this.
	
	NOTE: the interface and documenation was reviewed by zou#gnash and
	kshishkov#ffmpeg, it took time and wasn't easy. The requirement for 
	samples format was based on the current SDL expectances, which match
	the assumptions found all over the place in gnash.
	Further reviews are very welcome as I proceed to define subclasses.

2008-10-30  strk  <strk@gnash>

	First cleanup phase on sound_handler_sdl. 

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	const corrected AudioDecoder::decode

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add more documentation for the audioCodecType enum

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Some more consitency checking (driven by failed attempts to use ffmpeg-svn) and better debugging from FFMPEG media parser

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Probe for completed streaming sound and dispatch onSoundComplete then; reduce probing rate to 2 pps (probes per second); As a side-effect keeps the Sound instance alive thus fixing bug #23275.

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add test for streaming Sound.loadSound and onSoundComplete

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	More cleanups and fixes, hopefull fixes bug #24353 

2008-10-29  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Honour --with-ffmpeg-lib so it does look for libavcodec and libavformat too; big cleanup and comments addition; use top_lib_dir and top_incl_dir to reduce confusion.

2008-10-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tests for MovieClip._soundbuftime.

2008-10-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Use the RunInfo in parsing. Change the tag loader signature. These may
	all change back(!) if RunInfo becomes a member of movie_definition, or
	if a SWFMovieDefinition is passed instead of a movie_definition.
	
	Change initialization order in Player.h to fix a segfault.
	
	Use the sound_handler and StreamProvider from the RunInfo in parsing and
	execution.
	
	Update docs.

2008-10-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add documentation.

2008-10-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Fix segfault by changing initialization order and giving sound_sample a
	reference to the RunInfo. Add comment about fixing this.

2008-10-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Tidy up line breaks and indentation.
	
	Use the RunInfo StreamProvider.

2008-10-29  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass RunInfo to SWFMovieDefinition constructor so it can be used in parsing
	later without needing RunInfo passed again. This seems safer (enforces
	same RunInfo) and more convenient.
	
	Fix testsuite build.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Builds and works, MovieTester and libcore.all not yet.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	It builds.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Another intermediate stage.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	An intermediate stage.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Pass a RunInfo to create_movie and create_library_movie so it can be
	passed to the parser. This revision won't build.

	Update comments.
	
	Improve line breaks.

	Let AudioDecoderFfmpeg use Nellymoser when available

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add RunInfo to Makefile.am.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Replace globals namespace with a RunInfo class, to be externally owned and
	passed to movie_root on construction.
	
	Initialize VM from movie_root instead of the other way round. The movie_root
	instance is now owned by the hosting application.
	
	This is the first stage in refiguring the core. Still to do is:
	- give the parser code a movie_root reference
	- make movie_root own the VM (possibly with movie_root as a singleton as an
	intermediate stage)
	- add media handler and render handler to RunInfo
	- make movie_root available to as_objects without using a singleton (needs
	much work).

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add RunInfo.h, update comment, drop libsound from libmedia includes again.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	_baseURL has gone again.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Group necessary run information into a RunInfo class, presently containing
	the base URL, a swappable sound_handler (by pointer), and a StreamProvide
	(currently not used).
	
	This is designed to be owned by a hosting application, and passed to
	movie_root at construction time. The hosting application may change
	the sound_handler (and in future other handlers) as it chooses.
	
	Change movie_root constructor to take a RunInfo and hold a const reference
	to it.

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Initialize core using movie_root:
	
	movie_root(const movie_definition&, VirtualClock&, const std::string& baseURL);
	
	The VM is still a singleton, but initialized from movie_root.
	
	Move getBaseURL and getOriginalURL to movie_root. These may form part of a
	RunInfo class.
	
	Do not call movie_root::clear in gnash::clear, as this is a big risk of 
	accessing movie_root via the VM singleton after the movie_root has been
	destroyed. It also seems to have no purpose.
	
	Adjust other classes to get baseURL from movie_root.
	
	Drop set_base_url() and get_base_url().
	
	Do not call gnash::clear after movie_root has gone out of scope in 
	utilities/processor.cpp
	
	Adjust Player, gprocessor and MovieTester to use the new movie_root signature.
	They now own the movie_root instance.

2008-10-28  strk  <strk@gnash>

2008-10-28  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Update PlaceObject3 comments, notes about real-life cases. Just log parsing
	once, instead of two or three times.
	
	Use 0 instead of NULL in AudioDecode.h. NULL is a macro and may require
	an include (e.g. on mingw). 0 must be interpreted as the result of NULL
	by the compiler and doesn't need an include. Should fix the win32 build.

	Drop unused or useless methods of GnashImage. Clean up ImageInput and

	Disable double- and triple-click events.

2008-10-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Add more tests to LoadVars, including a check that empty data is the same as
	a failed load. Gnash has a timing problem: we should always
	wait before calling onData, but Gnash does so immediately if a load fails.
	That means stop() is called after play(), so the test hangs.
	
	Gnash's only job should be to call LoadVars.onData with an undefined argument
	if it receives no data, or a string if it gets something. The default onData
	method handles everything else.

2008-10-26  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test enumeration order of Transform methods. Put them in the right order.
	I might not do this for every object...

2008-10-25  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Enumerate in creation order, not lexicographically. Don't use a map to
	enumerate into, as that will sort it again. Use SortedPropertyList, which
	does not change the order of enumeration.
	
	Implement LoadVars.toString(), which relies on this order.

2008-10-20  strk  <strk@gnash>

	Add an example of how setting _width does NOT affect _yscale (since there are cases in which it does...)

2008-10-20  strk  <strk@ubuntu>

	Allow setting _width for characters w/out bounds (still not 100% correct: we don't change _yscale when setting _width or _xscale when setting _height)

	Test lastIndexOf, fix a bug that would have been obvious with good testing.

2008-10-20  Benjamin Wolsey  <bwy@benjaminwolsey.de>

	Test lastIndexOf properly and implement it correctly.
	
	Replace ENSURE_FN_ARGS macro with an inline function, give more information
	and use the AS function name, not the C function name.

2008-10-20  strk  <strk@ubuntu>

	Add tests for setting _width/_height on null-bounded chars (gnash fails..)

	ERRORS to DEBUG level.

	Check for perl and csound

2008-10-20  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Implement AAC audio decoding for FLVs analogous to H264.

2008-10-19  Bastiaan Jacques  <bastiaan@bjacques.org>

	Add support for FLVs with embedded H.264 video:
	libmedia/FLVParser.cpp: For h264, skip four extra bytes per FLV spec.
	Stop attempting to parse width and height for h.263, since it's not
	necessary (and our values for other video codecs were bogus).
	libmedia/FLVParser.h: Add FLV-specific extradata (for h264).
	libmedia/MediaParser.h: Add h264 to codec type enum.
	libmedia/ffmpeg/VideoDecoderFfmpeg.cpp: Add FLVParser's extradata.
	libmedia/gst: Update interfaces to include FLVParser's extradata.
