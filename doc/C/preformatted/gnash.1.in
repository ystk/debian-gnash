apply to the sequence of frames as the SWF is executed, not the
frame sequence defined in the SWF. Use in combination with
--screenshot-file to specify output filename.
.TP 
--screenshot-file file
Specify the output pattern for screenshot filenames. The token %f
in a pattern will be replaced with a frame identifier. If you specify
